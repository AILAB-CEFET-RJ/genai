### Mock Knowledge Base for AI and Bayesian Inference

Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It is widely used in machine learning, AI, and decision-making systems. 

Applications of Bayesian inference include:
- Spam filtering
- Medical diagnosis
- Predictive modeling
- Reinforcement learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks). It has revolutionized fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. 

Recent advancements in deep learning include:
- Transformer architectures (e.g., BERT, GPT)
- Self-supervised learning
- Vision transformers (ViTs)
- Large language models (LLMs) for AI agents

AI agents are intelligent systems that perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions. AI agents can be rule-based, data-driven, or use deep reinforcement learning. They are widely used in automation, virtual assistants, and robotics.

Types of AI agents:
- Reactive Agents: Do not use past memory (e.g., chess-playing AI)
- Goal-Based Agents: Use search and planning to achieve objectives
- Learning Agents: Improve over time with experience (e.g., reinforcement learning models)
- Conversational Agents: Utilize LLMs for natural language interaction (e.g., ChatGPT)

Hybrid memory in AI systems combines short-term memory (e.g., ConversationBufferMemory) and long-term memory (e.g., VectorStoreRetrieverMemory) to enable contextual understanding over extended interactions.
